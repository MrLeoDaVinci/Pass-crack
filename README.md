# Pass-crack
Dot Placement:

Click "Select Dots" to spawn three movable dots.

Green Dot: Position it over the username field.

Red Dot: Position it over the password field.

Blue Dot: Position it over the login button.

Important: Ensure there is empty space just to the right of each dot—this is where the automated clicks will occur.

Input Modes:

You can use either a user:pass combo list or separate username and password lists.

Do not use both input modes at the same time.

Timing:

Avoid setting the timer too fast—excessive speed can cause the bot to malfunction or miss interactions.

Limitations:

This bot will not bypass captchas or session timeouts.

Use a rotating proxy list to reduce the risk of getting blocked after too many failed attempts.


Press UP arrow key to toggle on and off.
